Here will be defined the useful classes that could be used for making the code easier and more understandable for anyone
After declaring a class it can be used in the [[app.py]] program

My idea is a class for files - because a file has some data stored in memory, like size, lastly used, encoding or what kind of kiterjeszt'es.
